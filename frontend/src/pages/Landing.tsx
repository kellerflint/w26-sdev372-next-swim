      <p>
        NextSwim supports individuals as they improve their swimming by
        performing an accurate swim level analysis through an interactive quiz.

        guidance tailored to their abilities.

      <p>
        Based on the quiz results, swimmers can access recommended aquatic
        training resources including in-water exercises, land-based fitness
